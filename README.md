### Project Overview
#### The setup for this project is simple. I am a Data Analyst at a fictional company who primarily sells pens. My director assigned me a data analysis task based on a business goal to better understand our customers. By cleaning and analyzing customer data, my task was to create an actionable recommendation to the business stakeholders, for the ultimate goal of increasing profit.
